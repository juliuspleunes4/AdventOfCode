# 🎄 Advent of Code 2025 

Welcome to my [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025) journey! This repository contains my solutions to the daily programming puzzles, implemented entirely in **Rust**.

## 🦀 About This Project

This is my **first ever project using Rust**, so this repository serves a dual purpose:
- **Learning Rust**: Getting hands-on experience with Rust's syntax and ecosystem
- **Solving Puzzles**: Tackling the creative and challenging problems that Advent of Code presents

Expect to see my code evolve as I learn more about Rust patterns and best practices throughout December!

## 📁 Project Structure

```
.
├── day01/
│   ├── puzzle/
│   │   ├── puzzle.txt
│   │   └── puzzle_input.txt
│   ├── part1.rs
│   └── part2.rs
├── day02/
│   └── ...
├── .gitignore
├── .gitattributes
└── README.md
```

Each day's solution is organized in its own directory with:
- `puzzle/` - Contains the puzzle description and input data
- `part1.rs` - Solution for Part 1
- `part2.rs` - Solution for Part 2

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (latest stable version)

### Running Solutions

```bash
# Compile and run a specific day's solution
cd day01
rustc part1.rs && ./part1
rustc part2.rs && ./part2
```

## 📅 Progress

## 💡 Learning Goals

- [ ] Understand Rust's ownership and borrowing system
- [ ] Master pattern matching and error handling
- [ ] Work with Rust's iterator patterns
- [ ] Explore common crates and libraries
- [ ] Learn about performance optimization in Rust

## 🤝 Suggestions?

This is a personal learning project, but I'm open to feedback and suggestions! If you spot something that could be improved or written more idiomatically, feel free to open an issue or reach out.
